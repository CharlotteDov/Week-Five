Podcasting:

-	Every one has the same basic structure. There’s an opening hook that is itself a little gem of story telling with its own internal structure (setup, rising conflict, climax, resolution) that sets the overall theme for the episode. There’s an opening sound/music clip reminding us that we’re listening to ‘Under the Influence.’ The theme is explained in a bit more detail. Then there are three or four more stories more directly germane to that overall theme, and then a final summary that reminds us how the different stories illustrate the theme, with a clever twist tying it all back to the opening hook
- Spent a lot of time playing around with Audacity, took some time to figure things out. Cleaning up the audio was hard and I spent quite a bit of time on that - turns out I don't talk as loud as I thought I did. The audio is definitely not as smooth as it good be, but I understand for next time what I need to do to clean it up a bit. Very proud of the fade out though I must say.

Sonification:

-	Sonification is the practice of mapping aspects of the data to produce sound signals. In general, a technique can be called ‘sonification’ if it meets certain conditions. These include reproducibility (the same data can be transformed the same ways by other researchers and produce the same results) and what might be called intelligibility - that the ‘objective’ elements of the original data are reflected systematically in the resulting sound
- I thought this tool was pretty interesting and I spent some time just playing around with the sounds. With this exercise, it again made me think about the authenticity of the data because you can place more emphasis on certain parts of the data, so I think, like Voyant, it's about trying to explore what you can do while keeping in mind the potential impact and changes being made to the original data. 
- My final product has a weird medieval court musician who doesn't know what rhythem is vibe, but I had fun trying different things. 

StoryMaps:

- I had fun with StoryMaps and found it super user friendly, I look forward to using it for future school projects.

Leaflet

- I found the mapping with Leaflet challenging, especially adding the new layer. Needed help with a coding issue in order to add that other layer. 
- I played around with Map Warper and got the map layering to work fairly well!

Types of Visualization:

- Information visualization is the mapping of abstract data to graphic variables in order to make a visual representation.
- An information visualization differs from a scientific visualization in the data it aims to represent, and in how that representation is instantiated. Scientific visualizations maintain a specific spatial reference system, whereas information visualizations do not. 
- An infographic is usually a combination of information and scientific visualizations embedded in a very explicit narrative and marked up with a good deal of text.
- Static visualizations are those which do not move and cannot be manipulated; dynamic visualizations are short animations which show change, either over time or across some other variable; interactive visualizations allow the user to manipulate the graphical variables themselves in real-time. 
- ‘Vector’ graphics are mathematical descriptions of points, lines, arcs, ellipses, squares and so on. If you’ve ever encountered an SVG file (‘scalable vector graphic’) then you’ve encountered a vector graphic. 
- Vectors always look sharp, at whatever magnification you encounter them. They print out sharp too.
- ‘Raster’ graphics on the other hand are actual splodges of colour in a grid. With a small enough grid, viewed from the right distance, the colours seem to merge into each other. But if you zoom in, you’ll see the individual blocks of colour - the pixels. Hence the term, pixellated. 
- Type Connection was really interesting, I made a match with ITC Century & ITC Franklin Gothic
- Why this pairing works:ITC Century and ITC Franklin Gothic are revivals that date back to American industry at the turn of the 20th century. Originally designed by Morris Fuller Benton or his father, Linn Boyd Benton, both exhibit the strength needed for typecasting machines. Tall x-heights and protruding ears—serif or not—represent the utilitarian voice of periodicals and magazines at that time.
